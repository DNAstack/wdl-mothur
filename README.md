# Workflow: Process 16S rRNA reads with mothur

## Purpose
This repository provides instructions and a workflow for processing 16S rRNA sequences from 507 individuals, including Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients and control samples using mothur[1]. The data source for this project is the Parkinson's Disease Bioproject available on NCBI BioProject (ID: 601994). The study associated with the data is titled "Characterizing dysbiosis of gut microbiome in PD: evidence for overabundance of opportunistic pathogens" [2].

## Metadata
While sample data metadata is not explicitly required for this workflow, metadata can be found in the scripts subdirectory in .csv format. Two raw metadata files were obtained directly from NCBI (`SraRunInfoExample.csv` and `biosampleDataExample.txt`) and were manipulated using two scripts found in the scripts subdirectory (`connecting_metadata.sh` and `PD_metadata_join.R`) to generate the PD_metadata.csv file. This .csv file was used for subsequent statistical analyses and data visualization. Examples of the two metadata files from NCBI are also present in the scripts subdirectory within this repository.

If the dereplicate parameter is false, then if one group finds the sequence to be chimeric, then all groups find it to be chimeric, default=f. If you set dereplicate=t, and then when a sequence is found to be chimeric it is removed from it’s group, not the entire dataset.

| Int | `classify_threshold` | Cutoff for your taxonomy input file in classify.otus command. It’s a way to after the fact “adjust” the cutoff used in classify.seqs command without having to reclassify
| Boolean | `check_orient` | If you are running the make.contigs command with paired barcodes or primers, you can use the checkorient parameter. When checkorient=t and mothur can’t find the barcodes and primers, it will search the reverse compliment. Default=true.

| Int | `quality_score_threshold` | Quality score threshold in make.contigs command
